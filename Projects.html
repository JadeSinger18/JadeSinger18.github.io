    <p>My teams project was an Air Circulation System for Mushrooms. Our Client was Ollin Farms which is a local sustainable farm owned by Mark Guttridge. The objective was for us to create an automated air circulation system for a mushroom cultivation project. The fan must be turned off when it is too hot/cold outside to maintain ideal mushroom growing temperature. The result is a highly sustainable fertilizer, composting method, and food source for the farmer.</p>
